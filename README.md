Exercise 1
  
  Given the dataset: (-5, -10), (-1, -3), (3, 5), (7, 8), (5, 7), (9, 9), find the regression line using
  Matrix Algebra Least Squares (slides 323-325). Find the parameters of the line and plot the data points along with the regression line
  Note 1: Your algorithm should be able to work with any dataset not just a dataset of 5 data
  points

Exercise 2

  Based on the dataset from Ex. 1, find the regression line using Ordinary Least Squares
 
Exercise 3
  Based on the dataset from Ex. 1, find the regression line using the built-in linregress()
  method (slides 331-334). Plot the data points along with the regression line and print: slope,
  y-intercept, r (correlation coefficient), p-value, standard error

Exercise 4
  
  Based on the dataset from Ex. 1, compute the: SST, SSR, SSE (slide 336) and the: r, R2

Exercise 5
  
  Given the grades.csv file, where the first column is hours studied and the second column is
  grades, read its data and place them into two numpy arrays. Find the regression line using the
  built-in linregress() method. Plot the data points along with the regression line
  and print: slope, y-intercept, r (correlation coefficient), p-value, standard error. Predict a studentâ€™s
  grade given 10.5 hours of study
